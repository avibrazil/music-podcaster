# music-podcaster
Aggregates multiple multi-format music files (MP3, FLAC, M4A, ALAC) into one "extended podcast" M4A file, complete with chapters and chapter images.

Then losslessly adapts the resulting media file into a YouTube-friendly video format.

Then upload it to YouTube and to your WordPress blog via APIs of these systems so you can serve it as a podcast.
A blog post will be created based on tags from the media files and from template text files found in the working folder.

See https://abstra.to as an example of a podcast managed and generated by this script.
